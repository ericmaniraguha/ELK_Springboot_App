# ELK_Springboot_App - Project Overview
       [ Spring Boot App ] --Logs--> [ Folder on Desktop ] --Logs--> [ Logstash ] --Processed Logs--> [ Elasticsearch ] --Indexed Logs--> [ Kibana ]

This project involves creating an application with the following components:

1. **Elasticsearch**
2. **Kibana**
3. **Logstash**

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Download and Install the following components:
   - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
   - [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)
   - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash)

## Configuration

1. Create a folder on your Desktop to store the logs generated by your application.
2. Configure your Spring Boot app to save logs into the designated folder (set up the path).
3. Configure Logstash to monitor the log files in the specified folder, process the logs, and send them to Elasticsearch.

## Springboot Dependencies

1. spring-boot-devtools
2. spring-boot-starter-web
3. spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch

## Data Flow

1. Logs are generated and stored in the designated folder on your Desktop or any other location.
2. Logstash processes the logs, filtering and enriching them as needed, before forwarding them to Elasticsearch.
3. Elasticsearch indexes the processed logs in its storage.
4. Kibana provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch.

# ELK_Springboot_App

# Microservices Logging | ELK Stack | Elastic Search | Logstash | Kibana |

## Project Setup
In this project, the focus was on integrating the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for microservices logging. The setup involved downloading and configuring Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana alongside the Spring Boot suite. 

To start, the following steps were performed:

1. Download and install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
2. Modify the Logstash sample configuration file (`logstash-sample.config`) to define the pipeline for processing and forwarding logs.
3. Configure Logstash to read logs from a specific file (`mylogfile.log`) by providing the full path.
4. Configure Logstash to send processed logs to Elasticsearch for storage.
5. Specify the Elasticsearch connection details, including the host URL, SSL settings, index name, and user credentials.

## Controller and Service
To ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase, the project was organized using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern. The code was split into a **controller** and a **service**, providing clear separation of responsibilities.

### UserController.java (Controller)
The `UserController` class serves as the REST controller responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests related to user data. It defines the `/getUser/{id}` endpoint, allowing retrieval of a user by their ID. The controller delegates the user retrieval logic to the `UserService`.

### UserService.java (Service)
The `UserService` class contains the business logic for retrieving user data. It includes the `getUserById` method, which takes an ID as input and returns the corresponding `User` object. If the user is found, an info message is logged. If the user is not found, an error message is logged, and a default `User` object is returned.

By separating the controller and service, the project maintains a modular and scalable code structure, facilitating ease of maintenance and future enhancements.
