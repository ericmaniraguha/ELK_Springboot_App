# ELK_Springboot_App - Project Overview
       [ Spring Boot App ] --Logs--> [ Folder on Desktop ] --Logs--> [ Logstash ] --Processed Logs--> [ Elasticsearch ] --Indexed Logs--> [ Kibana ]

This project involves creating an application with the following components:

1. **Elasticsearch**
2. **Kibana**
3. **Logstash**

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Download and Install the following components:
   - [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
   - [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)
   - [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash)

## Configuration

1. Create a folder on your Desktop to store the logs generated by your application.
2. Configure your Spring Boot app to save logs into the designated folder (set up the path).
3. Configure Logstash to monitor the log files in the specified folder, process the logs, and send them to Elasticsearch.

## Springboot Dependencies

1. spring-boot-devtools
2. spring-boot-starter-web
3. spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch

## Data Flow

1. Logs are generated and stored in the designated folder on your Desktop or any other location.
2. Logstash processes the logs, filtering and enriching them as needed, before forwarding them to Elasticsearch.
3. Elasticsearch indexes the processed logs in its storage.
4. Kibana provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze the data stored in Elasticsearch.

This setup allows for efficient log management, monitoring, and analysis, providing valuable insights for your application.
